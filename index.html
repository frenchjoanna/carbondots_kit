        You are here because either you’ve just read through <a class="external-link" href="https://thecarbonalmanac.org/" target="_blank">The Carbon Almanac</a> and are trying to figure out what to do next. Or a friend shared the site because you are an action person. Well, you have come to the right place.</p>
      <p>In the pages of this platform and the interactive graph you will find the ISSUES and ACTIONS to take and join the worldwide community of people who want to make a difference. </p>
      <div>
        <h3>It’s not too late to make changes.</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Choose actions that make sense to where and how you live, not everything will be right for everyone’s situation. Together we can make a real change. The systemic change that will make the difference. You can learn about the larger actions that bring collective voices together and help advocate to your officials to step up and help reduce carbon. This was made by people like you, people who care. </p>
      <p>We invite you to take a look around and get started.</p>
      <div>
        <h4>Here's how to dive in:</h4>
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Find an interesting heading and select it. Here are a couple to get you started:</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p><a href="Backyard Regeneration.html" class="internal-link">Backyard Regeneration</a> <a href="Mass Transit.html" class="internal-link">Mass Transit</a> <a href="Fast Fashion and Carbon.html" class="internal-link">Fast Fashion and Carbon</a> <a href="Composting.html" class="internal-link">Composting</a></p>
      <p><span><img src="/P:/Carbon Dots/assets/Welcome-CarbonDots.gif"></span></p>
      <p>You can see them starting to form a visual graph on the right hand side of the screen (this is a desktop or tablet only feature).</p>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>At the top of each page, you will see the title of the article that is referenced in The Carbon Almanac and then the number that refers to the online reference page to read more about the resources, check the work, and dig deeper. </li>
          <li>Further down are three actions that you can take to scale your impact from individual to a larger and broader results. </li>
          <li>And don’t forget to take a look at the Interactive Graph to see how these issues and actions are related to other opportunities to help reduce carbon impacts.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>Reading these opportunities may spark other ways to contribute to an issue or other solutions. This is just a starting point to help with next step thinking and action. Take a look at the short video for navigating around the site. </p>
      <p>And don’t forget to tell a friend!</p>
