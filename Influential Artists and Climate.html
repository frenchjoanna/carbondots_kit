    <h5>Issue:</h5>
    <p>Art is a reflection of the times and artists express and react to their environment, often leading the way and raising awareness.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Artists could benefit from patronage. Some cities and countries have begun introducing a stipend for working artists.</p>
    <p>Artists who focus on climate change can help to shape the conversation that needs to happen for change to become a reality. </p>
    <p>However, artists need support to make a living and be able to continue their important work. Some cities and countries have begun introducing a stipend for working artists as a form of patronage.</p>

    <p>The Carbon Almanac has collaborated with artists and photographers around the world to highlight their work. We have made a photo book that shows climate change in three stages: the disasters, the hope through restoration and technology, and the arts. Covers artwork courtesy of Shepard Fairey.

    <p>TCA has put together a comprehensive list of well known artists working on the subject of climate change. Follow them get acquainted with their works. Art is highly subjective and one may like one artist’s expression vs another. Yet, knowing what one intends to express, leads to a better understanding of what we see.</p>
